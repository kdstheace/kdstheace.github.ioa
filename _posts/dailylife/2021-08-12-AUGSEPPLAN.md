## After 2 real-world projects as a freelancer.

From June, I've just finished two real-world projects as a freelancer.
It was really great opportunity for me to experience how the real projects go and how the business and communications occurs 
between customers and SI company(WAVIEW). 

Both projects requires new language skills such as Python Flask, PHP, and other utilities and server knowledge that I've never seen before. 
Everything was so new for me and those days at work were priceless. I've learnt a lot, grown up a lot and understand overall
communications and teamwork as a developer. Even though I barely slept during those months, every moment was precious and full of fun. 


Anyhow, after two months, I decided to learn more of establishing infrastructure for web application and extend my knowledge from web application to
mobile application. Furthermore, skills for data engineering and AI are the key factors to become a developer that I wanted for a long time.

So here's my plan for upcoming two months.
