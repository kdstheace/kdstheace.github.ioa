It was really busy but worthy and promising day, because I finally built my own devlog! It feels like I took a big step further to my dream.

Since I've decided to become a IT developer, there were many obstacles and hard times which ironically made me more brave and stronger. Now, my journal and Devlog is ready, my body and brain is eager to **make something out of nothing**!

I would never stop until I achieve my dream; making a better future with building IT ecosystem.
